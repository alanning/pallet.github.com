The actions provide the basic primitives for pallet.  These actions can be
composed in crate functions to implement your configuration and operational
requirements.

See the [API](http://pallet.github.com/pallet/api/0.6/index.html) documentation
for details. In these examples, the first `session` argument is assumed to be
threaded, and is elided.

## Direct Script Execution

Sometimes pallet's other actions will not suffice for what you would like to
achieve, so the `exec-script` actions allow you to execute arbitrary script.

{% highlight clojure %}
(exec-script* "ls some/path")
(exec-script (ls "some/path"))
(exec-checked-script "List some path" (ls "some/path"))
{% endhighlight %}


## Simple File Management

Files can be managed using the `file`, `symbolic-link`, and `fifo` actions.

{% highlight clojure %}
(file "some/path" :owner "user", :group "group", :mode "0644")
(symbolic-link "original/path" "link/path")
(fifo "some/path" :owner "user", :group "group", :mode "0644")
{% endhighlight %}

## Simple Directory Management

Directories can be managed using the `directory`, and `directories` actions.

{% highlight clojure %}
(directory "some/path" :owner "user", :path true)
(directories ["some/path" "other/path"] :owner "root")
{% endhighlight %}

## File Contents

File contents can be manipulated with `remote-file`, `remote-directory`,
`rsync-directory` and `sed`.

{% highlight clojure %}
(remote-file "some/path" :content "Some content", :owner "user")
(remote-directory "some/path" :local-file "my.tar.gz")
(rsync-directory "local/path" "remote/path")
{% endhighlight %}

## Packages

Packages can be controlled via `package`, `packages`, `package-manager`, `package-source`,
`add-rpm`, and `minimal-packages`.

{% highlight clojure %}
(package "some/path")
(packages :aptitiude ["git-core"] :yum ["git"])
(package-manager :update)
(package-source
 "Partner" :aptitude {:url "http://archive.canonical.com/" :scopes ["partner"]})
(minimal-packages)
{% endhighlight %}

## Users and Groups

Users and groups can be created and removed with `user` and `group`.

{% highlight clojure %}
(user "tomcat" :system true, :shell "/bin/false", :group "tomcat")
(group "tomcat")
{% endhighlight %}

## Services

Init style services can be controlled with `service`, and `init-script`.

{% highlight clojure %}
(service "tomcat" :action :restart)
{% endhighlight %}
