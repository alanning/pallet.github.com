The session is used to hold state and context for the duration of a call
to the [`lift` or `converge` operations](/doc/reference/0.8/operations).

The settings, envrionment and results are all maintained in the session.  The
session also provides crates with access to the current node and other details.

## Access in crates

To access the information in the session, use the functions in
[`pallet.crate`](http://pallet.github.com/pallet/api/0.8/pallet.crate.html).

session map directly.
